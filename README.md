# Abilities API

[_Part of the **AI Building Blocks for WordPress** initiative_
](https://make.wordpress.org/ai/2025/07/17/ai-building-blocks)

## Overview

- **Purpose:** provide a common way for WordPress core, plugins, and themes to describe what they can do ("abilities") in a machine‑readable, human‑friendly form.
- **Scope:** discovery, permissioning, and execution metadata only. Actual business logic stays inside the registering component.
- **Audience:** plugin & theme authors, agency builders, and future AI / automation tools.

## Design Goals

1. **Discoverability** - every ability can be listed, queried, and inspected.
2. **Interoperability** - a uniform schema lets unrelated components compose workflows.
3. **Security‑first** - explicit permissions determine who/what may invoke an ability.
4. **Gradual adoption** - ships first as a Composer package, migrates smoothly to core.

## Inspiration

- **[wp‑feature‑api](https://github.com/automattic/wp-feature-api)** - shared vision of declaring capabilities at the PHP layer.
- Command Palette experiments in Gutenberg.
- Modern AI assistant protocols (MCP, A2A).
